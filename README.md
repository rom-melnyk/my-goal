# My Goal: gamification platform

With this platform I applied gamification principles to (personal) goal setting.



## Concepts

There are two players: **admin/moderator** who sets goals (campaigns) and the **player** who commits to a goal (campaign) and fulfills necessary steps to achieve it.



## Architecture and tech stack

The **server** is a REST API + simple mechanism of yielding static content. Tech stack: NodeJS + ExpressJS.

The **frontend** is a SPA (Angular + Typescript) that behaves differently for different users (admin and player).
